# Tic Tac Hue
A game of Tic Tac Toe with a little twist.

# Purpose
This was a project that I started as tic tac toe and converted to a color-based one in order to see the divisions better. I just went with it and here it is.

## Instructions

### Go to the [Firebase App](https://tic-tac-hue.firebaseapp.com/)

To initiate the game, click start and Player X will be able to select their first square

## Objectives

The user stories that drove this project were as follows:

- The board shall be 3 squares by 3 squares
- Player X shall go first, with Player O playing second, alternating
- Each player may only select one square during their turn
- A win shall be declared if either player has one of the following:
  - Three squares in one column
  - Three squares in one row
  - Three squares diagonally

##Bonus Objective Achieved

Other objectives that were completed:

- Multiple game rounds with a win counter
